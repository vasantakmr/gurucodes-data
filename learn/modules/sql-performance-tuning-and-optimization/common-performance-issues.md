### Identifying and Resolving Bottlenecks

1. **Slow Queries:Resolution:**

   - Optimize queries by reducing complexity.
   - Use indexes appropriately.

   **Example:**
   Identifying a slow query:

   ```sql
   SELECT Title, ReleaseYear
   FROM TeluguMovies
   WHERE Director = 'S. S. Rajamouli';
   ```

   Add an index:

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_director ON TeluguMovies (Director);
   ```

2. **Locking and Blocking:Resolution:**

   - Reduce transaction scope and duration.
   - Use appropriate isolation levels.

   **Example:**
   Using a transaction with a smaller scope:

   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE TeluguMovies
   SET ReleaseYear = 2021
   WHERE MovieID = 1;
   COMMIT;
   ```

3. **Insufficient Hardware Resources:Resolution:**
   - Upgrade hardware.
   - Optimize resource usage.
4. **High Disk I/O:Resolution:**
   - Optimize queries to reduce disk access.
   - Use indexing and caching strategies.
5. **Suboptimal Schema Design:Resolution:**
   - Normalize database schema.
   - Use appropriate data types and constraints.
