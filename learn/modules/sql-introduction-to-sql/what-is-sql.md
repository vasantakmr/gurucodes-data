title: "What is SQL?"
---

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. It's the tool we use to communicate with a database, to perform tasks such as retrieving data, updating records, and creating tables. Think of SQL as a way to ask your database a question or give it an instruction. Whether you want to find a list of customers, add a new order, or update a product's price, SQL is the language that makes it happen.
