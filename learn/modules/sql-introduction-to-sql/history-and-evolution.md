title: "History and Evolution"

SQL was born out of the need for a standard method of managing and manipulating relational databases. It all started in the early 1970s at IBM, where Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce developed SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) to interact with the company's System R, one of the first relational database systems. SEQUEL was later renamed SQL due to trademark issues.

By the late 1970s, SQL had gained traction and was adopted by several database vendors. In 1986, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standardized SQL, solidifying its role in the world of databases. Over the years, SQL has evolved, adding new features and capabilities with each update. Major databases like Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL have their own versions and extensions of SQL, but the core language remains the same.
