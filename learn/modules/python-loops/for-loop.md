title: "For Loop"
---

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range). It runs the block of code for each item in the sequence.

### Syntax:
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # code block
```

### Example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
```

### Real-world Example:
Dodagatta Nihar lists the tasks he needs to complete today:
```python
tasks = ["Check emails", "Attend meeting", "Write report"]
for task in tasks:
    print(f"Dodagatta Nihar needs to: {task}")
```

**Output:**
```
Dodagatta Nihar needs to: Check emails
Dodagatta Nihar needs to: Attend meeting
Dodagatta Nihar needs to: Write report
```
