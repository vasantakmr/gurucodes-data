title: "Advanced File Handling and Management"
---

Beyond basic reading and writing, Python offers advanced features for file handling, such as working with directories, handling different file types, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

**Key Topics:**

- **File Paths:**

  - **Absolute vs. Relative Paths:**

    - Absolute: Complete path from the root directory.
    - Relative: Path relative to the current working directory.

  - **Using `os` and `pathlib` Modules:**
    - **`os` Module:**
      - Functions like `os.path.join()`, `os.path.exists()`, `os.makedirs()`.
    - **`pathlib` Module:**
      - Object-oriented approach to handle filesystem paths.

  **Example with `pathlib`:**

  ```python
  from pathlib import Path

  path = Path('folder') / 'example.txt'
  with path.open('r') as file:
      content = file.read()
  ```

- **Working with Directories:**

  - Creating, deleting, and navigating directories using `os` and `pathlib`.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  import os

  # Create a directory
  os.makedirs('new_folder', exist_ok=True)

  # List files in a directory
  for filename in os.listdir('new_folder'):
      print(filename)
  ```

- **File Metadata:**

  - Accessing file size, modification time, permissions using `os.stat()` or `pathlib`.

  **Example with `pathlib`:**

  ```python
  from pathlib import Path

  path = Path('example.txt')
  print(path.stat().st_size)  # File size in bytes
  print(path.stat().st_mtime) # Last modification time
  ```

- **Handling Different File Types:**

  - **Text Files:** Handled with text modes and encodings.
  - **Binary Files:** Handled with binary modes.
  - **JSON, CSV, and Other Structured Data:**
    - Use modules like `json`, `csv`, `pickle` for structured data.

  **Example with JSON:**

  ```python
  import json

  data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
  with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
      json.dump(data, file)

  with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
      loaded_data = json.load(file)
  ```

- **File Permissions and Security:**

  - Managing file permissions using `os.chmod()`.
  - Ensuring secure file handling to prevent vulnerabilities.

- **Cross-Platform Considerations:**

  - Use `os.path` or `pathlib` to handle differences in path separators and conventions across operating systems.

- **Concurrency and File Locking:**

  - Managing access to files in multi-threaded or multi-process environments.
  - Use modules like `threading`, `multiprocessing`, or third-party libraries for file locking.

- **Error and Exception Handling:**
  - Comprehensive handling of possible errors using try-except blocks.
  - Cleaning up resources in case of failures.

**Example: Handling Paths with `pathlib`:**

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Define a path
path = Path('/home/user') / 'documents' / 'file.txt'

# Check if the path exists
if path.exists():
    print("File exists.")
else:
    print("File does not exist.")

# Iterate through directory
for file in path.parent.iterdir():
    print(file.name)
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use `pathlib` for more readable and maintainable path manipulations.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to make your programs robust.
- Ensure compatibility across different operating systems by avoiding hard-coded path separators.
- Use appropriate modules for different file types and structured data.
