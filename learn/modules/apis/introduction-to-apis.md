## What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software components to communicate with each other. In simple terms, APIs allow applications to interact, share data, and perform tasks without needing direct user interaction.

### Why Are APIs Important in Backend Development?

APIs are critical in backend development because:
- They **facilitate communication** between the client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend).
- They enable **modular development**, allowing different services to work independently.
- APIs can be exposed for **third-party integration** and allow external systems to interact with your app.



## What is HTTP?

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of any data exchange on the web, and it's a protocol used by APIs to send and receive data. It operates over a client-server model where a client sends a request, and the server sends back a response.

### Key HTTP Methods

| **Method** | **Description**                          | **Example**                                    |
|------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`      | Retrieves data from a server             | Fetch user information                         |
| `POST`     | Sends new data to a server               | Submit a registration form                     |
| `PUT`      | Updates existing data on a server        | Update user profile                            |
| `DELETE`   | Deletes existing data on a server        | Remove a user account                          |

### HTTP Status Codes

| **Code** | **Description**                          | **Example**                                   |
|---------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 200     | OK - The request was successful           | Data retrieved successfully                   |
| 201     | Created - A new resource has been created | User created after a `POST` request           |
| 400     | Bad Request - Invalid input               | Missing required fields in the request body   |
| 404     | Not Found - Resource not found            | User not found with the given ID              |
| 500     | Internal Server Error - Server crashed    | Unexpected error occurred on the server       |



## Basic Concepts: RESTful APIs

### What is a RESTful API?

A **RESTful API** is an API that follows the principles of **REST (Representational State Transfer)**, which is a lightweight, scalable, and flexible architecture commonly used for building web services. REST APIs primarily use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources.

### Principles of REST

1. **Stateless**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the necessary information to understand and process it.
2. **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over HTTP.
3. **Uniform Interface**: The same method should be used to interact with resources.
4. **Resource Representation**: Resources are represented via URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
5. **Cacheable**: Responses can be cached to improve performance.

### Example: REST API for User Management

| **Method** | **Endpoint**         | **Description**              |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| `GET`      | `/api/users`          | Retrieve all users            |
| `GET`      | `/api/users/{id}`     | Retrieve a single user by ID  |
| `POST`     | `/api/users`          | Create a new user             |
| `PUT`      | `/api/users/{id}`     | Update user by ID             |
| `DELETE`   | `/api/users/{id}`     | Delete user by ID             |
