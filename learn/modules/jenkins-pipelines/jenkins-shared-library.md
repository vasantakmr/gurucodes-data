- Build and test everything when it changes
- The database schema counts as everything

- Check-in often and early
- Stronger source code control
- Continuous integration is running unit tests whenever you commit code
- Automate the build and test everyone
- Keep the build fast with automated deployment

- Development of suitable test procedures is essential
- Well-developed test-suite required many resources for Cl server
- Conversion of familiar processes
- Requires additional servers and environments
- Waiting times may occur when multiple developers want to integrate their code around the same time
