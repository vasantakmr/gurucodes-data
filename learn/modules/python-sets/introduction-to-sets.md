**Sets** in Python are unordered collections of unique items. Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not maintain any order and do not allow duplicate elements. They are useful for operations that involve membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

### Key Properties of Sets:
- **Unordered**: Sets do not maintain the order of elements.
- **Unique Elements**: Sets do not allow duplicate elements.
- **Mutable**: Sets can be modified after creation (items can be added or removed).
- **Dynamic Size**: Sets can grow or shrink as needed.
