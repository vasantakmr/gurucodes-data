### 1. Sorting Algorithms

#### Bubble Sort
- **Explanation**: Bubble Sort is a straightforward comparison-based algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted. The algorithm "bubbles" the largest unsorted element to its correct position in each pass through the list. Despite its simplicity, it is inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n) – If the list is already sorted.
  - **Average Case**: O(n^2) – Due to repeated comparisons and swaps.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2) – For a reverse-sorted list.

#### Selection Sort
- **Explanation**: Selection Sort improves on Bubble Sort by finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process is repeated for each position in the list until it is sorted. It’s more efficient than Bubble Sort in terms of the number of swaps but still has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the repeated searching of the minimum element.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n^2) – Always performs the same number of comparisons.
  - **Average Case**: O(n^2) – Due to searching for the minimum element.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2) – Same as average case.

#### Insertion Sort
- **Explanation**: Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted portion. This is done by comparing the element to elements in the sorted portion and shifting the larger elements up to make room for the new element. It is efficient for small lists or nearly sorted lists but has a time complexity of O(n^2) for larger datasets.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n) – If the list is already sorted.
  - **Average Case**: O(n^2) – For random order lists.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2) – For reverse-sorted lists.

#### Merge Sort
- **Explanation**: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. This algorithm is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is better than Bubble Sort and Selection Sort for large lists. The merging process ensures that the final list is sorted.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n log n) – Always divides and merges in the same manner.
  - **Average Case**: O(n log n) – Due to consistent divide and merge steps.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n log n) – Same as average case.

#### Quicksort
- **Explanation**: Quicksort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two sub-lists, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-lists are then sorted recursively. Quicksort is efficient with an average time complexity of O(n log n) but can degrade to O(n^2) if the pivot elements are poorly chosen.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n log n) – When the pivot divides the list into nearly equal parts.
  - **Average Case**: O(n log n) – For most practical cases.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2) – For poorly chosen pivots, like in a reverse-sorted list.

### 2. Searching Algorithms

#### Linear Search
- **Explanation**: Linear Search is the simplest search algorithm. It works by iterating through each element in the list sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached. It is easy to implement but inefficient for large lists, with a time complexity of O(n). It is best suited for unsorted or small datasets where more complex algorithms are unnecessary.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(1) – If the target element is the first element.
  - **Average Case**: O(n) – For a random position of the target element.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n) – If the target element is at the end or not in the list.

#### Binary Search
- **Explanation**: Binary Search is a more efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target element is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half. This process is repeated until the element is found or the interval is empty. Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it much faster than Linear Search for large datasets.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(1) – If the target element is in the middle of the list.
  - **Average Case**: O(log n) – Due to dividing the search space.
  - **Worst Case**: O(log n) – If the element is not present or at the end.

### 3. Dynamic Programming

#### Overview
- **Concept**: Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations. It is particularly useful for optimization problems where overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties exist. By solving each subproblem once and storing its result, DP algorithms achieve efficiency and reduce computation time.

#### Problems
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Computes the nth Fibonacci number by using previously computed values to reduce redundant calculations. The naive recursive approach has exponential time complexity, while the DP approach (memoization or tabulation) has linear time complexity.
- **Knapsack Problem**: Determines the maximum value that can be obtained with a given weight limit by selecting items with specific weights and values. The DP approach involves creating a table where each entry represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a certain weight capacity.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Finds the longest subsequence present in both sequences, maintaining the order of characters. The DP approach involves constructing a table to store lengths of longest common subsequences for different subproblems.

### 4. Greedy Algorithms

#### Overview
- **Concept**: Greedy Algorithms make the most optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. They work by selecting the best option available at the moment without considering the consequences of this choice on future steps. Greedy algorithms are simpler and often faster but may not always lead to the globally optimal solution.

#### Problems
- **Coin Change Problem**: Finds the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using a set of coin denominations. The greedy approach works well if the coin denominations are such that a greedy choice leads to an optimal solution (e.g., U.S. coin system).
- **Huffman Coding**: Compresses data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones. The greedy approach builds a binary tree by repeatedly merging the least frequent nodes until a single tree is formed.
- **Activity Selection**: Selects the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person given their start and finish times. The greedy approach sorts activities by their finish times and selects them if they do not overlap with previously selected activities.

### 5. Graph Algorithms

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Explanation**: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack to keep track of nodes and explores each node’s children before moving to the next sibling. DFS is useful for tasks such as finding connected components and solving puzzles with constraints. It has a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(V + E) – For traversing all nodes and edges.
  - **Average Case**: O(V + E) – For most practical cases.
  - **Worst Case**: O(V + E) – Same as average case.

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Explanation**: BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes and is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. BFS has a time complexity of O(V + E), similar to DFS.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(V + E) – For traversing all nodes and edges.
  - **Average Case**: O(V + E) – For most practical cases.
  - **Worst Case**: O(V + E) – Same as average case.

#### Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- **Explanation**: Dijkstra’s Algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights. It uses a priority queue to repeatedly select the node with the smallest tentative distance. It’s efficient for graphs with positive weights and has a time complexity of O(V^2) with an adjacency matrix or O((V + E) log V) with a priority queue.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(V^2) – For dense graphs with adjacency matrix.
  - **Average Case**: O((V + E) log V)
