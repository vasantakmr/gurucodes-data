title: "Types of Design Patterns"

Design patterns are generally categorized into three main types based on the problem they solve:

### 2.1 **Creational Patterns**: Handling Object Creation
Creational patterns focus on how objects are created. Instead of creating objects directly, these patterns provide ways to instantiate them in a controlled and efficient manner.

- **Why Do We Need Them?**: Direct object creation (using `new` or constructors) can lead to complicated and tightly coupled code. Creational patterns help manage this by allowing objects to be created in a more flexible and scalable way.

- **Common Problems Solved**: 
  - Managing object creation when we want to control how objects are instantiated.
  - Avoiding repetitive code for creating similar objects.
  - Allowing more flexibility in the type of object being created.

### 2.2 **Structural Patterns**: Organizing Classes and Objects
Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed. They help ensure that if different parts of a system need to work together, they do so efficiently and transparently.

- **Why Do We Need Them?**: As software grows, it can get messy if objects and classes donâ€™t interact efficiently. Structural patterns help you create relationships between different entities in your system that are both easy to maintain and scale.

- **Common Problems Solved**:
  - Combining objects and classes to create large and complex systems.
  - Providing a simplified interface to a complex system.
  - Ensuring that incompatible objects can still work together.

### 2.3 **Behavioral Patterns**: Managing Object Interactions
Behavioral patterns are concerned with the communication between objects. They define how objects interact and exchange responsibilities, often leading to better coordination and reduced complexity.

- **Why Do We Need Them?**: In large systems, objects often need to interact in ways that can become complicated. Behavioral patterns help define these interactions in a clean and structured manner.

- **Common Problems Solved**:
  - Managing how different objects communicate with each other.
  - Encapsulating behaviors and interactions between objects to make the code more flexible and maintainable.
  - Allowing objects to communicate in a loosely coupled way.
