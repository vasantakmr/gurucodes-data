### 1.1 **What Are Design Patterns?**
Design patterns are proven, general solutions to common problems in software design. Instead of writing code from scratch every time you encounter a problem, design patterns provide **predefined, best-practice templates** for solving these problems. 

Think of them like blueprints or recipes that guide developers in building scalable and maintainable software.

### 1.2 **Why Do We Use Design Patterns?**
Software development often involves solving similar problems over and over again. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, **design patterns** offer:
- **Reusability**: You can reuse solutions that have already been tried and tested.
- **Standardization**: They offer a common vocabulary for discussing solutions among developers. If someone says "Factory Pattern," other developers will know exactly what they mean.
- **Efficiency**: They help you write better code faster because you're not starting from scratch.
- **Maintainability**: Code that follows established patterns is easier to understand and maintain over time.
- **Flexibility**: They allow you to write more modular and adaptable code that can change without breaking everything.

### 1.3 **Common Use Cases for Design Patterns**
- **When building scalable systems**: As systems grow in size and complexity, design patterns help ensure that code remains organized and adaptable.
- **When following best practices**: Patterns help enforce best coding practices by promoting clean architecture and separation of concerns.
- **When dealing with common problems**: Many common software design problems (like object creation, structure, or communication between components) can be solved using a design pattern.
