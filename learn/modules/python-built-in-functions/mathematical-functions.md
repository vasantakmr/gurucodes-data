Python provides a set of built-in functions that are always available for use. These functions perform common tasks and operations, simplifying coding and reducing the need to write repetitive code. Built-in functions cover a range of functionalities, from mathematical operations to type conversions.

## Mathematical Functions

### `abs()`
Returns the absolute value of a number.

**Syntax:**
```python
abs(number)
```

**Example:**
```python
print(abs(-5))  # Output: 5
```

### `pow()`
Returns the power of a number, optionally with a modulus.

**Syntax:**
```python
pow(base, exp[, mod])
```

**Example:**
```python
print(pow(2, 3))         # Output: 8
print(pow(2, 3, 5))      # Output: 3
```

### `round()`
Rounds a floating-point number to a specified number of decimal places.

**Syntax:**
```python
round(number[, ndigits])
```

**Example:**
```python
print(round(3.14159, 2))  # Output: 3.14
```
