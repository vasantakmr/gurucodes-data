### 4.1 **Routing**
- The process of mapping a URL to a handler function or controller in your web application.
- Each framework has its routing system; e.g., **URLs.py** in Django or **app.get()** in Express.js.

### 4.2 **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**
- A way to interact with databases using programming language objects instead of SQL.
- Frameworks like Django (Django ORM) and Rails (ActiveRecord) have built-in ORMs.

### 4.3 **Middleware**
- Software that lies between the request and response in a web application.
- In Express, middleware is central to the app's flow.

### 4.4 **Templating Engines**
- Tools for embedding data into HTML files dynamically.
- E.g., **Jinja** in Flask or **EJS** in Express.js.

### 4.5 **Authentication & Authorization**
- Implement secure login systems using frameworks’ built-in libraries.
- **Django**: Django’s Authentication system.
- **Spring**: Spring Security.
