## Introduction

**Dictionaries** in Python are unordered collections of items stored as key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to a specific value. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after they are created. They are ideal for situations where you need to associate unique keys with specific values.

### Key Properties of Dictionaries:
- **Unordered**: Dictionaries do not maintain any order for their items.
- **Mutable**: You can change, add, and remove items in a dictionary after creation.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Each item in a dictionary is a pair consisting of a key and a value.
- **Unique Keys**: Dictionary keys must be unique and immutable types (such as strings, numbers, or tuples).
