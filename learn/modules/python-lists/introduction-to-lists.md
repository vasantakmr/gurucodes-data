title: "Introduction to Lists"

**Lists** in Python are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after they are created. They are a versatile and commonly used data structure in Python.

### Key Properties of Lists:
- **Ordered**: Items have a defined order, and that order will not change unless you explicitly reorder the list.
- **Mutable**: You can change, add, and remove items after the list has been created.
- **Allows Duplicates**: Lists can contain duplicate elements.
- **Dynamic Size**: The size of a list can change as you add or remove elements.
