title: "Data Types"
---

Data types define the kind of data that can be stored in a column. Common data types include:

- **INT**: Integer numbers.
- **VARCHAR(size)**: Variable-length strings.
- **CHAR(size)**: Fixed-length strings.
- **DATE**: Date values.
- **FLOAT**: Floating-point numbers.
- **BOOLEAN**: True/false values.

**Example:**
In the `Movies` table example above:

- `MovieID` is an integer.
- `Title` and `Director` are variable-length strings.
- `ReleaseYear` is an integer.
- `Genre` is a variable-length string.

**Real-life Example:**
Choosing data types is like deciding what kind of documents go into each folder in your drawer. Some folders might hold numbers, others text, and some might have dates.
