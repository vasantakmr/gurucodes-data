### 6.1 **Decentralized Data Management**
- Each microservice should manage its own data. Avoid sharing databases between services to maintain loose coupling.

### 6.2 **Use API Gateways**
- Use API gateways to route requests, manage security, and aggregate responses. This decouples client interactions from internal microservice implementation details.

### 6.3 **Embrace Asynchronous Communication**
- For better performance, microservices can communicate asynchronously using message brokers (like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**) instead of always relying on synchronous REST calls.

### 6.4 **Monitoring and Observability**
- Use distributed tracing and monitoring tools (e.g., **Prometheus**, **Jaeger**) to keep track of how services are interacting and to identify bottlenecks.

### 6.5 **Automate Testing and Deployment (CI/CD)**
- Each microservice should be tested independently, and continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines should be in place to automate the testing and deployment process.
