### 1. **What Are Microservices?**
**Microservices** is an architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service typically focuses on a specific business functionality, communicates with other services via lightweight protocols (like HTTP or messaging queues), and is independently scalable and replaceable.

- **Monolithic Architecture**: Traditionally, applications were built as monolithic systems where all components (UI, logic, database access) are tightly coupled and deployed together.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Breaks down monoliths into smaller, independent units that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.

### 2. **Key Features of Microservices**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service focuses on a specific, singular functionality (e.g., user authentication, payments).
- **Loose Coupling**: Services are independent of each other, meaning changes in one service donâ€™t directly affect others.
- **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Resilience**: Failures in one service do not impact the entire system. With proper error handling, other services continue to function even if one fails.
- **Language and Technology Agnostic**: Different services can be built using different programming languages or technologies, as long as they communicate via APIs or messaging systems.
